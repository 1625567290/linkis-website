## 1. Applicant review specification

When voting, all PMC members need to decide whether to approve the candidate as the submitter. They may search mailing lists and JIRA to find out how candidates interact with others and their contributions (code or document patches, suggestions, participation in conversations).

Here are some key points to consider when assessing a candidate's commitment qualifications.

1. How do we evaluate the ability to cooperate with peers?
    - 1.1 through their interaction via email.
    - 1.2 through how they respond to criticism.
    - 1.3 through how they participate in the group decision-making process.

2. How do we evaluate the ability to become a mentor?
    - 2.1 through their clarity and their willingness to identify and even create appropriate background materials.
    
3. How do we evaluate the community?
    - 3.1 are they helpful in answering the questions raised in the mailing list?
    - 3.2 do they show a helpful attitude and respect the ideas of others?
    
4. How do we evaluate the commitment?
    - 4.1 completion of tasks according to the time given to the project.
    - 4.2 how do they stick to the process through difficult problems.
    - 4.3 through how they help complete less interesting tasks.

5. How do we evaluate personal skills/abilities?
    - 5.1 have a solid overall understanding of the project.
    - 5.2 quality discussed in email.
    - 5.3 whether their patches (if applicable) are easy to apply requires only a rough review.
