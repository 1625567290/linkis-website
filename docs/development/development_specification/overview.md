In order to standardize Linkis's community development environment, improve the output quality of subsequent development iterations of Linkis, and standardize the entire development and design process of Linkis, it is strongly recommended that Contributors follow the following development specifications:
- [Exception Handling Specification](exception_catch.md)
- [Throwing exception specification](exception_throws.md)
- [Interface Specification](api.md)
- [Log constraint specification](log.md)
- [Concurrency Specification](concurrent.md)
- [Path Specification](path_usage.md)

**Note**: The development specifications of the initial version of Linkis1.0 are relatively brief, and will continue to be supplemented and improved with the iteration of Linkis. Contributors are welcome to provide their own opinions and comments.
